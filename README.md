# odin-recipes

This is the little introducing project with using HTML.
Briefcase my beginner knowledge of web and recipes of my favorite food(or not).

Aftermaths:
I used all my knowledge to make a project with all the conditions and successfully completed. Although it turned out to be a little poor due to copy-paste. I am happy with the result.
(Poor grammar due google translate and bad english knowledge)
